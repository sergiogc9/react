This package exports some custom React hooks.

ℹ️ The library is still in a beta stage as I am still migrating many components here.

ℹ️ This library has been implemented by me and for me, hence it is highly opinionated.

## Usage

#### Installation

Install the package from npm or github packages:

```
yarn add -S @sergiogc9/react-hooks
```

Then import and use the wanted hook.

#### Documentation

The hooks can be found inside the `src` directory. You can check every hook description in the code file itself.
