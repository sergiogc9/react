This package exports some re-usable components.

ℹ️ Here no UI components will be found, I have implemented a [React UI Library](https://github.com/sergiogc9/react-ui) where many UI components following a design system can be found.

ℹ️ The library is still in a beta stage as I am still migrating many components here.

ℹ️ This library has been implemented by me and for me, hence it is highly opinionated.

## Usage

#### Installation

Install the package from npm or github packages:

```
yarn add -S @sergiogc9/react
```

Then import and use the wanted component.

#### Documentation

The components can be found inside the `src` directory. You can check every component description in the code file itself.
